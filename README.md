## Master in Computer Vision, Barcelona 2021-2022 - Module 6: Video Analysis

This module is devoted to explore Computer Vision techniques to the problem of Road Traffic Monitoring, 
using video sequences of vehicles in roads. Throuought the weeks, we present different strategies for estimating 
background information, detecting foreground objects, estimating optical flow and tracking objects.

Mainly two datasets are used for this project:

- *KITTI dataset*: This dataset offers pairs of images corresponding to a video sequence of a road, as well as the optical flow ground truth.
  Train set: 194 instances, Test set: 195 instances (image pairs + Optical flow GT)

- *AI City dataset*: This dataset offers 3.25 hours of videos showing road interections and driving vehicles. 40 cameras were used in 10 different intersections.
The dataset offers the frame-by-frame bounding boxes of each vehicle, giving a total of 229,680 bounding boxes for 666 different vehicles.

## Week 1

The task corresponding to week 1 were devoted to explore the available data in the datasets, as well as the metrics for evaluation.
We make use of the ground truth anotations available in AI City dataset to asses and understand the Avergage Precission and 
Intersection over Union metrics. Furthermore, we add Gaussian noise to the ground truth to explore how the metrics evolve.
We also evaluate detectors using the given predictions made by state-of-the-art techniques such as Mask RCNN, SSD and YOLOV3.

Then we move to the task of optical flow estimation with the Kitty dataset. For this task we aim to comprehensively assess the 
detections given by the Lucas-Kanade algorithm in some instances of the dataset. We use MSEN and PEPN evaluation metrics and 
then perform some visual analysis of the results. One of the goals is to find a well suited method to visualize the optical flow.

The division of the tasks is the following:
- Task 1: Intersection over Union (IoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Task 2: Evolution of IoU over time
- Task 3.1: Mean Square Error in Non-occluded areas (MSEN) and Percentage of Erroneous Pixels in Non-occluded areas (PEPN) metrics to evaluate Optical Flow
- Task 3.3: Analysis and Visualization of Optical Flow errors
- Task 4: Optical Flow visualization

To run each section explained in the slides, we have created many files denoted as task_{id_task_{...}}.py, where {...} has some further information. These files are to be run as follows:

```
$ python week1/task_{id_task_{...}}.py
```

## Week 2
The tasks corresponding to week 2 presented the problem of background estimation from video sequences, by means of Gaussian modelling methods.
This family of methods pose the problem as a statistical model, where each pixel of each frame is modelled as a Random Variable
with additive Gaussian noise. The mean and variance of the noise is set according to the mean and std over a set of frames, 
specifically the initial 25% of frames. This results in a mean and std matrix, with the shape of the input images, 
that will be our model for the background. By comparing consecutive new frames with the mean, we can detect sudden 
changes in the pixel values, and hence moving objects. Furthermore, the detections are converted into connected components 
to perform foreground estimation.

We tested different versions of the model by applying an adaptive scheme for updating the mean and std, and perform hyperparameter search
for tuning the alpha and rho parameters. The method is compared with state of the art models. Finally, we test the 3D Gaussian model using different color spaces.

The division of the tasks is the following: 
- Task1: Modeling of the background with a single gaussian estimation
- Task2: Modeling of the background with a single gaussian estimation adaptatively
- Task3: Background removal algorithms in comparison with our method
- Task4: Modeling of the background with a single gaussian estimation adaptatively (RGB case)

## Week 3
The tasks corresponding to week 3 were devoted to explore both Object Detection and tracking algorithms in order to detect and identify vehicles in the *AI City dataset*.
To implement the Object Detection algorithms we have used the Detectron2 library using and testing the performance of both Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet models with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101 as backbone, respectively. The models were tested using the weights of the COCO-dataset, fine-tuned with the first 25% of the video sequence and 4-fold cross-validation in the same sequence.
Regarding the tracking, we have tested the Maximum Overlap method and the Kalman Filter using the IDF1 metric.

The division of the task is the following:
- Task 1.1: Object Detection with off-the-shelf weights
- Task 1.2: Object Detection fine-tuning the models with the first 25% of the sequence
- Task 1.3: Object Detection with a 4-fold cross-validation over the same sequence
- Task 2.1: Tracking by Maximum Overlap
- Task 2.2: Tracking by Kalman Filter

## Week 4
The tasks corresponding to week 4 were devoted to explore the Optical Flow estimation and how it could improve the tracking using it, and Object Detection and tracking in more than video Sequence.
