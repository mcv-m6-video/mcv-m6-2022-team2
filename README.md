# TrackNet: End-to-End Model for Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring

This project is devoted to explore Computer Vision video techniques to track cars across multiple cameras at a single intersection and multiple intersections spreading out in a mid-size city.

The dataset used is a subset of 3 sequences of the *AI City dataset*. This dataset offers 3.25 hours of videos showing road intersections and driving vehicles. 40 cameras were used in 10 different intersections. The dataset also offers the frame-by-frame bounding boxes of each vehicle, giving a total of 229,680 bounding boxes for 666 different vehicles.

In addition to the main challenge in this repository there are several studies done such as background estimation and optical flow estimation and representation. The corresponding detailed expositions are inside the w1, w2, w3 and w4 folders. However, all the code corresponding to the main challenge is in the w5 folder.

This module has been done by 4 students of the MSc in Computer Vision for the M6-Video Analysis module:

### Introduction

In this repository we present *TrackNet*, a model capable of detecting and tracking cars across intersections in more than one camera. The model is based on a Faster R-CNN with ResNeXt101 backbone, Deep SORT with some refinements and Triplet Metric Learning with ResNet50 backbone for the object Re-ID.

The model pipeline is the following:

All the model justification and results are in the following slides: [SLIDES](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hbSbUkJ5XG_9_Yyj9-YAxtO10loXa0TE8gJzPEHQc4k/edit?usp=sharing)

### Car Detection

The first step of the model is to run a finetuned Faster R-CNN with ResNext101 backbone to predict the position of the cars frame-by-frame with theit bounding boxes. We reach a top **Average Precision of 0.9852** on the c010 of S03.

### Single-camera Tracking

Once the cars are detected we tested several tracking algorithms (Max Overlap, SORT, Deep SORT) to track and relate the bounding boxes which are from the same car along the frames. The best performing technique was Deep SORT wtih an **average IDF1 of 0.7447** over all the sequences.

### Multi-camera Tracking

Once all the cars have been assigned to a track along the same camaera, TrackNet relates them to be able to identify the same car in different cameras.

To do so, the model uses a Triplet Network with ResNet50 as backbone to implement Deep Metric Learning computing features from every tracklet. Once each tracklet has an embedding the Re-ID model matches all the similar tracklets from different cameras ensuring a cross-match condition.

### Instalation

This code is implemented in Python3.6+, [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

### Run the System

If you want to reproduce our results, please dowload the datasets from [AI City Challenge 22](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/2022-data-and-evaluation/) and put them in a folder called *data* outside the repository:

├── data
   ├── AICity_data
      ├── train
         ├── S01
         ├── S03
         ├── S04
         
├── mcv-m6-2022-team2
   ├── w1
      ...
   ├── w5
      ├── main.py
      ├── AICity.py
         ...
      ├── utilities
      
The user has the ability to select which training sequences (S01, S03...) want by switching the train_seq parameter of the the AICity object in the *w5/main.py* file. The pipeline creates a data folder inside *w5* in which all the predictions are stored divided in different folders depending on the training sequences. Furthermore, the user has the ability of running just some parts of the pipeline just by comenting the corresponding lines in the *w5/main.py* file.

So to run the TrackNet run:
```
$ python w5/main.py
```
